Hello guys,
Checkout the working version of this <a href="https://moix197.github.io/TodoApp/" target="_blank">here</a>

This is just an app to practice my react skills, nothing fancy. 
It's working with the browser local storage so you can use it as a personal to do app if you want.

If you have any doubt <a href="mailto:moix197@gmail.com">just send me an email</a>
